# INVERSION GRID
#
# ASKI supports several types of inversion grids for FORWARD_METHOD = SPECFEM3D:
#
#   ASKI_type_inversion_grid = 1, (TYPE_INVERSION_GRID = schunkInversionGrid) NOT TO BE USED WITH SPECFEM3D Cartesian!
#      ASKI internal, but SPECFEM independent simple spherical inverison grid
#
#   ASKI_type_inversion_grid = 2, (TYPE_INVERSION_GRID = scartInversionGrid)
#      ASKI internal, but SPECFEM independent cartesian inversion grid:
#      the values for ASKI output are stored at all inner GLL points of spectral elements which lie
#      inside the block volume defined below by parameters ASKI_(cw)(xyz)
#      ASKI loactes the coordinates of those points inside the inversion grid cells and computes
#      integration weights for them
#
#   ASKI_type_inversion_grid = 3, (TYPE_INVERSION_GRID = ecartInversionGrid)
#      external inversion grid provided e.g. by CUBIT, which may contain tetrahedra, as well as hexahedra
#      as in case of ASKI_type_inversion_grid = 2, ASKI output is stored at all inner GLL points of elements
#      which are inside the volume defined by ASKI_(cw)(xyz)
#      ASKI locates the wavefield points inside the inversion grid and computes weights
#
#   ASKI_type_inversion_grid = 4, (TYPE_INVERSION_GRID = specfem3dInversionGrid)
#      use SPECFEM elements as inversion grid:
#      wavefield points are ALL GLL points of an element for elements which are (at least partly) inside the 
#      volume defined by ASKI_(cw)(xyz)
#      additionally store the jacobians for all wavefield points
#      assume ncell = ntot_wp/(NGLLX*NGLLY*NGLLY) as the number of inversion grid cells, and the order of 
#      wavefield points accordingly (do k=1,NGLLZ; do j=1,NGLLY; do i=1,NGLLX; ip=ip+1 ....)
#
#   ASKI_type_inversion_grid = 5, (TYPE_INVERSION_GRID = chunksInversionGrid) NOT TO BE USED WITH SPECFEM3D Cartesian!
#      ASKI internal, but SPECFEM independent more elaborate spherical inverison grid
#
# Dependent on ASKI_type_inversion_grid, (a selection of) the following parameters may be used to define a volume 
# within which wavefield points are searched for:
#
# First, ASKI_wx,ASKI_wy,ASKI_wz define the total width of a block which is centered in x=y=z=0
#    e.g. the total block extension in x-direction covers all points with 
#    x >= - 0.5*ASKI_wx and
#    x <=  0.5*ASKI_wx
# Then, ASKI_rot_X,ASKI_rot_Y,ASKI_rot_Z define rotation angles in degrees by which the block is rotated (anti-clockwise)
# about the Z, Y and X coordinate axis,
# before ASKI_cx,ASKI_cy,ASKI_cz define a vector by which the rotated block is shifted (new center of block)
#
# BE AWARE:
# - the parameters for rotation angles ASKI_rot_(XYZ) MUST ALWAYS be assinged to values! set to 0. if not used
# - scartInversionGrid only supports ASKI_rot_Z and uses a different definintion of the z-coverage
# - ecartInversionGrid and specfem3dInversionGrid use ALL rotation angles ASKI_rot_(XYZ)
