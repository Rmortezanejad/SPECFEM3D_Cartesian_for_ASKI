The files in this repository (except this file [README.md](README.md) and file 
[documentation/SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI_manual.pdf](documentation/SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI_manual.pdf)
were originally provided in a directory `SPECFEM_for_ASKI/` that was packed to `SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI_0.3.tar.gz` 
and provided for download on [http://www.rub.de/aski](http://www.rub.de/aski). It was supposed to be copied into
the installation directory of the ASKI main package. Keept this in mind, when reading
the [README](README) or the [manual](documentation/SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI_manual.pdf).
