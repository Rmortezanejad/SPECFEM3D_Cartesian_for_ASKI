THIS IS A VERY SHORT DOCUMENTATION ON HOW TO GET
STARTED WITH

  SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_3.0  for  ASKI - versions 1.0 to 1.2

####################################################

SPECFEM3D_Cartesian for ASKI, as well as ASKI and some of its components,  
documentation and examples are available via https://github.com/seismology-RUB
Please find contact addresses there, or visit http://www.rub.de/aski in case 
you want to get in touch with the authors. If you encounter any problems
installing or using the software, it will be helpful to open (or add to) an 
"issues" topic at the respective repository on https://github.com/

The main authors are Florian Schumacher (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany)
and Wolfgang Friederich (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany), 2016.

##########
USAGE, DOCUMENTATION
##########
Read the documentation doc/SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI_manual.pdf for information on 
how to set parameters correctly and how to use SPECFEM3D_Cartesian as a forward solver 
for ASKI.


##########
REQUIREMENTS
##########
1) You require an installation of the ASKI main package, available via
   https://github.com/seismology-RUB/ASKI :
   git clone --depth 1 --branch master https://github.com/seismology-RUB/ASKI
   The directory created by the git clone command will be referred to below as "ASKI/"

2) You need a functioning installation of the SPECFEM3D_Cartesian code, including 
   modifications for usage with ASKI:
-> You can either use the basic extract from the SPECFEM3D_Cartesian master branch
   (by November 2015) that comes with this package in subdirectory specfem3d/
-> OR use your running installation of SPECFEM3D_Cartesian and extend it for usage
   with ASKI (see "EXTEND REGULAR SPECFEM3D" below).
   Also refer to the manual doc/SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI_manual.pdf, sections 1.3, 1.4

   IN BOTH CASES YOU STILL MUST INSTALL THIS PACKAGE (item "INSTALLATION", below).

3) You need basic experience in using the regular SPECFEM3D_Cartesian software!


##########
INSTALLATION
##########
You should have already cloned the latest version of the master branch of the gitHub 
repository https://github.com/seismology-RUB/SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI to THE SAME 
directory where you have cloned the ASKI main package to (in the ASKI documentation 
exemplarily called /your/programs/). That is, make sure that the git clone command
created the directory /your/programs/SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI (also referred to 
below simply as SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI/) and ASKI was installed to directory
/your/programs/ASKI (also referred to below simply as ASKI/) .

You need to compile few more ASKI binaries:
+ in SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI/Makefile , set COMPILER appropriately, 
   adjust FFLAGS if required and set the variables BLAS, LAPACK, just as you did 
   for installing the ASKI main package
+ execute the command
      make all
   from path SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI/
After that, ASKI/bin/ should contain the new binaries.


##########
EXTEND REGULAR SPECFEM3D
##########
If you have a regular SPECFEM3D_Cartesian installation which has the required 
functionality, you may modify your installation for usage with ASKI in the following way.
This procedure was tested for SPECFEM3D_Cartesian git master by 7 Nov 2015, extended by 
two important modifications which were commited to the devel branch on 3 september 2015, 
or are about to be commited by the developers team:
1) src/specfem3D/setup_sources_receivers.f90 , subroutine
setup_sources(), l.180 :
   removing "USE_FORCE_POINT_SOURCE .or." from the if-clause, i.e. execute
   (re)definition of t0 only in case of USE_RICKER_TIME_FUNCTION == .true.
2) src/specfem3D/compute_add_sources_viscoelastic.f90 :
   always call function comp_source_time_function_gauss() with half duration
   hdur_gaussian(isource) instead of fixed value of 5.d0*DT
If your regular SPECFEM3D_Cartesian installation has this functionality, you can 
extend it for ASKI by the following 12 steps:

1) install SPECFEM3D_Cartesian on your system and make it run, gain 
   experience in using it (below, the installation path is refered to as 
   "specfem3d/")

2) copy file SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI/specfem3D_for_ASKI.f90 to 
   specfem3d/src/specfem3D/

3) replace file specfem3d/src/generate_databases/model_external_values.f90 by 
   SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI/model_external_values.f90

4) append content of file SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI/parallel_ASKI.f90 
   to file specfem3d/src/shared/parallel.f90

5) append content of file SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI/specfem3D_par_ASKI.f90 
   to file specfem3d/src/specfem3D/specfem3D_par.f90

6) in specfem3d/src/specfem3D/rules.mk : add the following line into the 
   definition of specfem3D_OBJECTS (e.g. before line with "$(EMPTY_MACRO)")
	$O/specfem3D_for_ASKI.spec.o \
   (be aware that the above line MUST start with an actual TAB character in order 
   to conform to the GNU-make syntax)

7) in specfem3d/src/specfem3D/prepare_timerun.F90 in subroutine prepare_timerun :
   add the following line at the end of the subroutine, before the statistics 
   output is written to main output file by rank 0:
      call prepare_timerun_ASKI()

8) in specfem3d/src/specfem3D/iterate_time.F90 in subroutine iterate_time : 
   add the following line just before the "enddo" of the time loop
      call write_ASKI_output()

9) in specfem3d/src/specfem3D/finalize_simulation.f90 in subroutine finalize_simulation : 
   add the following line just before the main output file is closed at the end of the subroutine
      call save_ASKI_output()

10) Set USE_SOURCES_RECVS_Z = .true. in specfem3d/setup/constants.h (or wherever 
    your file constants.h is located).

11) recompile all SPECFEM3D binaries by calling "make" in directory specfem3d/

12) in order to use ASKI in SPECFEM3D simulations, copy file 
    SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI/Par_file_ASKI to your respective DATA/ path
    (which is e.g. specfem3d/EXAMPLES/my_example/DATA/ , or specfem3d/DATA/ ). This 
    file must be adjusted for any specific simulation (just as all other parameter files), 
    refer to documentation or examples on how to use it.

Additionally, you may refer to the manual doc/SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI_manual.pdf
section 1.4 for details on extending a regular SPECFEM3D code copy for use with ASKI.
