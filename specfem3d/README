THIS IS A VERY BASIC EXTRACT FROM THE GIT REPOSITORY
https://github.com/geodynamics/specfem3d (master branch)
OF THE CARTESIAN SPECFEM3D PROGRAM BY   *** 7th november 2015 ***
SOME FOLDERS LIKE utils, doc ETC. WERE REMOVED TO KEEP THIS COPY SMALL

ON YOUR SYSTEM, YOU NEED TO CONFIGURE AND COMPILE AGAIN, e.g.:
> ./configure FC=gfortran MPIFC=mpif90
> make default
As is required for ASKI, I set USE_SOURCES_RECEIVERS_Z = .true. 
directly in file setup/constants.h.in, so that calling ./configure
does not modify this requirement.

THE ORIGINAL FILE "README.md" WAS RENAMED "README.md.original"

Some modifications were applied by me (Florian Schumacher, Ruhr-Universitaet Bochum, Germany, 2015)
in order to use this SPECFEM3D version 3.0 for ASKI versions 1.0 to 1.2
(as described by the documentation "EXTEND REGULAR SPECFEM3D" in ../README.md and
section 1.4 of ../doc/SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_for_ASKI_manual.pdf)
Additionally, two important modifications were applied, which were commited
to the devel branch on 3 september 2015, or are about to be commited by the 
developers team  (see comments by "FS FS"):
1) src/specfem3D/setup_sources_receivers.f90 , subroutine setup_sources(), l.180 :
   removing "USE_FORCE_POINT_SOURCE .or." from the if-clause, i.e. execute
   (re)definition of t0 only in case of USE_RICKER_TIME_FUNCTION == .true.
2) src/specfem3D/compute_add_sources_viscoelastic.f90 :
   always call function comp_source_time_function_gauss() with half duration
   hdur_gaussian(isource) instead of fixed value of 5.d0*DT
