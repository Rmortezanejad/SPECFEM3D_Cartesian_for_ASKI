ASKI_inversion_cross_borehole
AS PROVIDED ON https://github.com/seismology-RUB/ASKI/releases/tag/v1.0 .

IN ORDER TO RUN THIS EXAMPLE, YOU STILL NEED TO COMPILE BINARIES ON YOUR 
SYSTEM. THEREFORE, RUN THE configure SCRIPT AND RUN make FROM ROOT 
DIRECTORY ../../ OF THIS SPECFEM3D CODE.

THE MESH FILES CONTAINED IN SUBDIRECTORY MESH/ ARE MESH FILES FOR THE
FIRST ITERATION OF INVERSION ASKI_inversion_cross_borehole .
FILES DATA/Par_file DATA/Par_file_ASKI ARE ADJUSTED FOR THE FIRST
ITERATION, AS WELL.

SUBDIRECTORY DATA/DATA_homogeneous_halfspace_HEX8_elastic_no_absorbing
CONTAINS ORIGINAL CONTENT OF DATA/ FROM SPECFEM3D EXAMPLE 
homogeneous_halfspace_HEX8_elastic_no_absorbing .

GOOD LUCK RUNNING THIS PROGRAM.
